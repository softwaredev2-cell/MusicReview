            <h2>Withered</h2>
            <p>About the album: WITHERED was primarily created on BandLab, where David poured his heart and soul into every track. This album is more than just a collection of songs-it's a deeply personal journey that reveals the raw, unfiltered essence of who David truly is. Through its haunting melodies and powerful lyrics, WITHERED explores the complex emotions of grief, loss, confusion, and love-emotions that David has lived through and now invites listeners to experience with him.</p>
